This project inteds to be a quick taste of React development and is targeted for beginers.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## We have slides!

If you found this repo and want to follow the presentation material, please go to the [slides deck](https://slides.com/thiagodallacqua/react-101).

### Intro

This material was intended for a "code along" approach, so, for each exercise you will have a `/solution` folder.

If you're reading this and didn't attend to the workshop, the idea behind the interaction here is to progressively uncomment the `import`s and fix each file properly to make the application work again. You can always uncomment the `/solution` and comment the exercise one to check how did you performed or you can go straight to the `/solution` folder and get a sneak peek to unblock you.

### Scripts

In order to run your application simply do a `npm i && npm start` from the root.
